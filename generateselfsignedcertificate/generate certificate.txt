2. Generating a Self-Signed Certificate
Before getting started, we'll create a self-signed certificate. We'll use either of the following certificate formats:

PKCS12: Public Key Cryptographic Standards is a password protected format that can contain multiple certificates and keys; it's an industry-wide used format.
JKS: Java KeyStore is similar to PKCS12; it's a proprietary format and is limited to the Java environment.
We can use either keytool or OpenSSL tools to generate the certificates from the command line. Keytool is shipped with Java Runtime Environment, and OpenSSL can be downloaded from here.

For our demonstration, let's use keytool.
